## ServiceStatus

The `ServiceStatus` class captures a point-in-time snapshot of a service's operational state, including performance metrics and health status. It tracks key attributes like CPU/memory usage, process state, and health check results to provide a comprehensive view of service health.

### Usage Example

```csharp
var status = new ServiceStatus
{
    ServiceInfoId = Guid.NewGuid(),
    UnitName = "nginx.service",
    State = ServiceState.Active,
    SubState = ServiceSubState.Running,
    IsEnabled = true,
    IsRunning = true,
    ProcessId = 1234,
    CpuUsagePercent = 2.5m,
    MemoryUsageMb = 50,
    HasFailed = false,
    ExitCode = 0,
    UptimeSeconds = 3600,
    HealthStatus = HealthStatus.Healthy,
    HealthMessage = "Service is running normally.",
    RecordedAt = DateTime.UtcNow
};

Console.WriteLine($"Service {status.UnitName} is {status.State} with {status.CpuUsagePercent}% CPU usage");
```
